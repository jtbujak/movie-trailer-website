# Movie Trailer Website
This is my movie trailer website project for Udacity.  The program, written in Python, will generate HTML code for a web page that will display my favorite movies along with the corresponding movie poster.  If the user clicks on the movie poster, the movie trailer will play.

# Necessary Software
This program was written using Python 3.6.2.  You will need to have Python installed on your computer in order to run the _Movie Trailer Website_ program.

# How to Run the Program
Make sure that the files: `entertainment_center.py`; `media.py`; and `fresh_tomatoes.py` are all installed in same folder. Open the program `entertainment_center.py` to run the program and create the movie trailer website.
